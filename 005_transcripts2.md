scriptions of manufactures in which it is fitted to be available. An inventor, who has made himself com pletely master of this work, will have obtained a knowledge both of all the principa expedients which have hitherto been employed in mechanics, and of the scientific principles upon which all mechanical devices must depend; and a man so instructed, it may be fairly inferred, will be likely not only to waste but little time in re-discovering what has been already found out, but also to find his efforts in original invention crowned with far more rapid and more satisfying success than would have otherwise attended them. 

From the multiplicity of most interesting subjects of which Mr Babbage has treated the mere enumeration of which would far exceed our limits we select only two specimens of the entertainment to be found in the work. The following account of a foreign manufacture would appear incredible, if we did not know to what singular uses the instincts of animals may be directed: -  

***"Lace made by Caterpillars.- A most extraordinary species of manufacture, which is in a slight degree connected with copying, has been contrived by an officer of engineers residing at Munich. It consists of lace and veils, with open patterns in them, made entirely by caterpillars. The following is the mode of proceeding adopted:- Having made a  paste of the leaves of the plant, on which the species of caterpillar he employs feeds, he spreads it thinly over a stone, or other flat substance, of the required size. He then, with a camel-hair pencil dipped in olive oil, draws the pattern he wishes the insects to leave open. This stone is then placed in an inclined position, and a considerable number of the caterpillars are placed at the bottom. A peculiar species is chosen, which spins a strong web; and the animals commence at the bottom, eating and spinning their way up to the top, carefully avoiding every part touched by the oil, but devouring every other part of the paste. The extreme lightness of these veils, combined with some strength, truly surprising. One of them, measuring twenty-six and a half inches by seventeen inches, weighed only 1.51 grains, a degree of lightness which will appear more strongly by contrast with other fabrics. One square yard of the substance of which these veils are made weighs four grains and one-third, whilst one square yard of silk gauze weighs one hundred and thirty-seven grains, and one square yard of the finest patent net weighs two hundred and sixty-two grains and a half."***

One of the most important manufactures of our own country is that connected with the Press, in all its various and complicated operations. The following account of the mode in which a great London newspaper is prepared, will be read with interest in all parts of the kingdom :- 

“Another instance of the just application of machinery, even at an increased expense arises where the shortness of time in which the article can be produced, has an important influence on its value. In the publication of our daily newspapers, it frequently happens that the debates in the Houses of Parliament are carried on to three and four o’clock in the morning, that is, to within a very few hours of the time for publication of the newspaper. The speeches must be taken down by reporters, conveyed by them to the establishment of the newspaper, perhaps at the distance of one or two miles, transcribed by them in the office, set up by the compositor, the press corrected, and the papers printed off and distributed before the public can read them. Some of these journals have a circulation of from five to ten thousand daily. Supposing four thousand to be wanted, and that they could be printed only at a rate of five hundred per hour upon one side of the paper (which was the greatest number two journeymen and a boy could take off by the hold hand presses), sixteen hours would be required for printing the complete edition and the news conveyed to the purchasers of the latest portion of the impression would be out of date before they could receive it. To obviate this difficulty, it was often necessary to set up the paper in duplicate, and sometimes when late, in triplicate: but the improvements of the printing-machines  have been so great, that four thousand copies are now printed on one side in an our.

It is scarcely imagined by the thousands who read that paper in various quarters of the globe, would have seen of organized activity that factory presents during the whole night, or what a quantity of talent and mechanical skill is put into action for their amusement and information.* Nearly 100 persons are employed in this establishment, and during the session of Parliament at least 12 reporters are constantly attending the Houses of Commons and Lords, each in his turn, after about an hour's work, retiring to translate into ordinary writing. Speech has just heard and noted in shorthand. In the mean time, 50 compositors are constantly at work, some of whom have already set up the beginning, whilst others are committing to type the yet undried manuscript of the continuation of a Speech whose middle portion is traveling to the office in the pocket of the hasty reporter, and whose eloquent conclusions Perhaps. At the very moment making the walls of Saint Stephens vibrate with the applause of its hearers, these congregated types, as fast as they are composed, are passed in portions to other hands, till at the last the scattered fragments of the debate forming. When united with the ordinary matter, 8 and 40 columns reappear in regular order on the platform of the printing press. The hand of man is now too slow for the demands of his curiosity, but the power of steam comes to his assistance. Inc is rapidly supplied to the moving types by the most perfect mechanism for attendants incessantly introduced the edges of large sheets of white paper to the junction of two great rollers, which seemed to devour them with unsated appetite. Other rollers convey them to the type already inked, and having brought them into rapid and successive contact, redeliver them to four other assistants completely printed by the almost momentary touch. Thus, in one hour, 4000 sheets of paper are printed on one side, and an impression of 12,000 copies from above 300,000 movable pieces of metal is produced for the public in six hours."

Zoological Society 

The last monthly report of the Proceedings of the Committee of Science to the Zoological Society contained several facts of general interest. 

The female Puma and the Society's gardens brought forth two young ones on the 2nd of April. The ground color of these is of a paler. Fawn than that of either of the parents, and they are deeply spotted. The eyelids of one of them was partially unclosed on April 9th. The mother, whose temper was always mild, has since become. Remarkably gentle purring when the keeper goes into her den and allowing her young ones to be handled and carried  about without appearing... 

* The author of these pages, with one of his friends, was recently induced to visit this most interesting establishment after midnight during the progress of a very important debate. The place was illuminated with gas, and was light as the day. There was neither nor noise, nor bustle, and the visitors were received with such calm and polite attention, they did not until afterwards become sensible of the inconvenience with such intruders. At a moment of the greatest pressure. Music must occasion nor reflect that the tranquility which they admired was the result of intense and regulated occupation. But the effect of such checks in the current of business will appear on recollecting and as 4000 newspapers are printed off on one side within the hour, every minute is attended with a loss of 66 impressions. The quarter of an hour, therefore, which the strangers may think it not unreasonable to claim the gratification of his curiosity, and to him this time is but a moment, may cause a failure in the delivery of 1000 copies, and disappoint A proportionate number of expectant readers, and some of our distant towns, to which the morning papers are despatched by the earliest and most rapid conveyance of each day. This note is inserted with the further in more general purpose of calling the attention of those, especially foreigners, who are desirous of inspecting our larger manufactories to the chief cause of the difficulty which frequently attends their introduction. When the establishment is very extensive in its departments skillfully arranged, the exclusion of visitors arises not from any illiberal jealousy. You are generally from any desire of concealment, which would in most cases be absurd from this sub. Annual inconvenience and loss of time throughout an entire series of well combined operations, which must be occasioned even by short and casual interruptions.

Craigmillar Castle.

This beautiful ruin is situated about 3 miles to the southward of Edinburgh. It stands on a circular, Rocky Hill and commands an extensive prospect on every side comprehending the city of Edinburgh. The distant mountains of the Highlands and the fine arm of the sea called the Firth of Forth. The front of the building is towards the north. Over one of the doors is a car is carved a press and a cask in illusion. It is believed the name of Preston. It was surrounded by a thick rampart, 30 feet high, with parapets and turrets of which considerable part. Means there is an inner court of considerable extent, and there is also a very large outer court on the West side, of which there was erected a Presbyterian meetinghouse in Consequences of the indulgence granted to that persuasion by James the 7th of Scotland. The period. In this castle was built, is not ascertained, which probably arises from the records and other papers they public, Nature respecting Scotland, being lost in their conveyance by sea from London to Edinburgh, when, after having been carried by Cromwell, they were ordered to be restored by Charles the 2nd. But the Rampart, as appears by the inscription upon the gate, was built in 1427. 

The council was for some time the residents of James the 5th when he left Edinburgh on account of the plague. It was taken and part of it demolished by the English in 1543 when Henry the Eighth invaded Scotland in order to compel the young Queen of Scots to marry his son Prince Edward. 

Mary, Queen of Scots resided for some time in this castle after her return from France in 1561. Her French servants took up their abode in a neighbouring village which is yet known by the name of Little France, and an in a room in the castle is still called Queen Mary's Drawing Room. 

The castle and surrounding the state belonged so far back as the year 1374 to the family of Preston. They now belong to the descendants of Sir Thomas Gilmore, the great Scottish lawyer who acquired the property about the time of the revolution.

Gratitude and Ingratitude

Gratitude is a virtue disposing the minds to an inward sense, and an outward acknowledgement that benefit received together with a readiness to return the same or the like, as occasions of the doer of it shall require, and the abilities of the receiver extends to. In gratitude is an insensibility of kindness received without any endeavor either to acknowledge or repay them. In gratitude, citizens throne with pride at its right hand and cruelty at its left. Were these supporters of such a state? You may rest upon this as an unfailing truth that they're neither is nor ever was any person or. Remarkably ungrateful who is not so. He was not also insufferably proud, nor anyone proud who is not equally ungrateful new paragraph In gratitude overlooks all kindnesses, and this is because pride makes it carry its head so high. In gratitude is two base to return a kindness, and too proud to regard it, much like the tops of mountains, buried indeed, but yet lofty, they produce nothing. They feed nobody, they clothe nobody, yet are high in stately, and looked down upon all the world about them. It was ingratitude which put the poniard into Brutus's hand, but it was want of compassion which thrust it into Caesar's heart. Friendship consists properly in mutual offices and a generous strife and alternate acts of kindness. But he who does a kindness to an ungrateful person sets his seal to a flint And sows his seed upon the sand:- upon the former he makes no impression, and from the latter he finds no production. - Dr South

Column for Mothers 

Mrs Child in American Authoress, who, like the excellent Miss Edgeworth, has done a great deal to instill rules of conduct into the minds of young people by means of a series of useful little works, gives the following valuable advices to mothers in the subject of teaching children politeness.-

"In politeness, as in many other things connected with the formation of character, people in general begin outside when they should begin inside. Instead of beginning with the heart and trusting that to form the manners, to begin with the manners and trust the heart to chance influences, the Golden Rule contains the very life and soul of politeness. Children may be taught to make a graceful courtesy or a gentlemanly bow. But unless they have likewise been taught to abhor what is selfish and always prefer another's comfort and pleasure to their own, their politeness will be entirely artificial and used only when it is their interest to use it. On the other hand, a truly benevolent, kind hearted person will always be distinguished for what is called native politeness. Though entirely ignorant of the conventional forms of society.

I by no means think graceful manners of small importance. They are the outward form of refinement in the mind, and good affections in the heart, and as such must be lovely. But. When the form exists without the vital principle within, it is as cold and lifeless as flowers carved in marble. 

Politeness, either of feeling or of manner, can never be taught by set maxims every day. Influence so unconsciously exerted is all important in forming the characters of children, and in nothing more important than in their manners. If you habitually polite, your children will become so by the mere force of imitation, without any specific directions on the subject. Your manners at home should always be such as you wish your family to have in company. Politeness will then be natural to them. They will possess it without thinking about it. But when certain outward observations are urged in words as important only because they make us pleasing, they assume an undue importance, and the unworthiness of the motive fosters selfishness. Besides, if our own manners are not habitually consistent with the rules we give, they will be of little avail. They will in all probability be misunderstood and will certainly be forgotten. 

Foreigners charge the Americans with the want of courtesy to each other in their usual intercourse, and I believe there is some truth in the accusation. On all great occasions, however, they are ready heart and hands to assist each other. But how much more gracefully and happily the French manage, and the 10,000 pretty petty occurrences of life, And after all, life is made-up of small events. The golden chain of existence is composed of innumerable little links, and if we rudely break them, we injure its strength, as well as mar its beauty.

It is a graceful habit for children to say to each other, 'Will you have the goodness?'- and 'I thank you.' I do not like to see prim, artificial children. There are a few things I dislike so much as a miniature bow or bell. But the habit of good manners by no means implies affection or restraint. Is quite as easy to say. Please to give me a piece of pie as to say "I want a piece of pie."

The idea that constant politeness would render social life too stiff and restrained springs from a false estimate of politeness. True politeness is perfect ease and freedom. It simply consists in treating others just as you love to be treated yourself. A person who acts from this principle will always be said to have a sweet, pretty ways with her. It is of some consequence that your daughter should know how to enter and leave her room gracefully, but it is. Of prodigiously more consequence that she should be in the habit of avoiding whatever is disgusting or offensive to others, and have always preferring their little pleasure to her own, If she have the last of very little intercourse with the world, will teach her the first. 

I believe nothing tends to make people so awkward as too much anxiety to please others. Nature is graceful and affectation with all her art can never produce anything half so pleasing. The very perfection of elegance is to imitate nature as closely as possible. And how much better it is to have the reality than the imitation, I shall probably be. Minded that the best and most unaffected people are often constrained and awkward and company to which they are unaccustomed, I answer the reason as they do not act themselves, they are afraid they shall not do right in that very fear makes them do wrong. Anxiety about the opinion of others fetters the freedom of nature at home when they act from within themselves. They would appear 1000 times better. All would appeal well if they never tried to assume what they did not possess. Everybody is respectable and pleasing so long as he is perfectly natural. I will make no exception. Nature is always graceful. The most secluded and the most ignorant have some charm about them, so long as they affect nothing. So unless they speak and act from the impulses of their honest hearts without anxiety as to what others think of it. 

Coarseness and vulgarity are the effects of education and habit; they cannot be charged upon nature. 


#### Middle Column

True politeness may be cherished in the hovel as well as in the palace, and the most tattered drapery cannot conceal its winning charms.

As far as this, consistent with your situation and duties, early accustom your children to an intercourse with strangers. I have seen young persons who are respectful and played at home, seized with the most painful and unbecoming bashfulness. As soon as a guest entered. To avoid this evil, allow children to accompany you as often as possible when you make calls and social visits. Occasional interviews with intelligent and cultivated individuals have a great influence on early character and manners, particularly if parents evidently place a high value upon acquaintances of that description. I have known the destiny of a whole family changed for the better by their friendship of one of its members with the person of superior advantages and correct principles. 

But it must be remembered that a call or a social visit may be made almost as injurious as a party if children be encouraged in showing off or constantly habituated to hearing themselves talked about. Much as the failing has been observed in laughed at, it is still too common for mothers to talk a great deal about their children. The weariness with which strangers listen to such domestic accounts, the slight evil compared with the mischief done to children by inducing them to think themselves of so much importance, they should never be taught to consider themselves of any consequence except at home in the bosom of their own families. 

Nothing tends to foster the genuine politeness which springs from good feelings so much as scrupulous attention to the aged. There is something extremely delightful and salutary in the free and happy intercourse of the old and the young. The freshness and enthusiasm of youth cheers, The dreariness of age and age can return the benefit one hundredfold by its mild maxims of experience and wisdom. In this country, youth and age are too much separated. The young flock together and we leave the old to themselves. We seem to act upon the principle that there cannot be sympathy between these two extremes of life, whereas there may be in fact a most charming sympathy, a sympathy more productive of mutual benefit than any other in the world. 

The aged, from the loneliness of their situation, the want of active employment in an enfeebled state of health, are apt to look upon the world with a gloomy eye, and sometimes their gloom is not unmixed with bitterness. Hence the rise is a complaint of their harshness and asperity towards the follies of youth. These evils, so naturally growing other isolated situation, would sound them gain power over the old if they were accustomed to gentleness, attention and deference from the young. It would be softened by juvenile love and cheered by juvenile gayety. Such intercourse sheds a quiet brightness on the decline of life, like sunshine on a weather beaten tree or a Moss covered dwelling. What is there on earth more beautiful than an aged person full of content and benevolence!

One very prevalent fault among children is a want of politeness to domestics. Young people should not, from mere women Caprice, be able to make demands upon the time and patience of those who are hired to attend upon the family. They should make no unnecessary trouble in the kitchen, and when they ask for anything, they should speak politely saying 'Will you have the goodness,' 'I thank you,' &c. Such conduct greatly tends to make domestics more respectful, kind, and obliging. 

Mrs Madison was esteemed the most thoroughly plight woman in America. Others might perhaps enter a room as gracefully or as or superintend at table with as much dignity. The secret of her power lay in her wonderful adaptation to all sorts of characters. She was emphatically and observing woman, as Jefferson had no wife. She presided 16 years at Washington, during all which time she is said never to have forgotten the most trifling peculiarities of character that had once come under her observation. She always. Read them and fashioned her conversation accordingly. Some may object to the exercise of this power, lest it should lead to insincerity, and the charge may well be brought against that kind of false politeness which brings me like from a love of popularity. Politeness is not the only good thing corrupted by an unworthy aim. All precious coins have a counterfeit when we are polite to others entirely for our own sakes. We are deceitful. Nothing selfish has truth and goodness in it. But there is such a thing as true politeness, always kind but never deceitful. It is right to cherish goodwill towards all our fellow creatures and to endeavour to make them as happy as we conscientiously can. The outward form of forms of politeness are but the expression of such feelings as should be in every human heart. It would be wrong to tell people we love them dearly, when in fact we know nothing about them, or to urge them to visit our houses when we do not want to see them. But we are bound to be kind and attentive to all our fellow creatures when they come in our way, and to avoid giving them any unnecessary pain by our manners and conversation.   

In order to teach children the right sort of politeness, it must be taught through the agency of a pure motive. They should not be taught to observe and respect the feelings of others for the sake of making

themselves pleasing, but merely because it is kind and benevolent to do so.

Outward politeness can be learned in set forms at school, but at the best it will hollow and it will be hollow and deceptive. Genuine politeness, like everything else that's genuine, must come from the heart."

Janet and Her Web.

Many years ago, in the parish of Karst Fearn in Galloway, a rude and sequestered district, there were only three free Masons, the minister and a tailor and a Mason. The Mason, being desirous to introduce his son to the same mystery, caused a lodge to be called for the purpose, and a lonely cottage where the ceremonies were proceeding when a knock was heard at the door. The Mason, whose name was Don, went to see who it was and found an old woman who addressed him as follows:-

"The Masons are met the nicht?"

"Yes."

"Weel, ye ken my web was stolen last week."

"Yes, Janet: but what business has that wi' the Mason meeting?"

"Ou, ye ken, ye'll be raising the de'l, and And I wad just like if you wad ask him, since he's there at any rate, what stole the web."

"Oh ay, Janet; Just you gang away then and we'll see what we can do."

Mr. Dun then returned to the interior of the cottage and mentioned to the minister what had passed between him and the old women. The clergymen rebuked him severely for conceding to the soup. Distichous notions of the aged Crone and said he feared that it would affront them. Ah, nay fiero that entered the Mason. Just leave it all to me. Next day, when Janet called upon Mr. Dunn, he told her the Dell had not exactly communicated the name of the thief, but he had mentioned that if the goods were not returned before Thursday next the House of the guilty person would fall upon him in the night time and the whole family would be killed. This, he said, was a great secret, and he strictly forbade her communicating it to more than one person. 

Away went Janet, satisfied, although it might have been expected to occur to her, that the prediction of punishment to a thief was not exactly a characteristic piece of conduct on the part of Old Nick. The secret was speedily imparted to her next door neighbor, with many injunctions as to the propriety of letting it go no farther notwithstanding which it was known to the whole parish before night. 

On the third morning thereafter Janet's Webb was found lying at her door with a parts which had been cut off, attached to the main body of it with pins. The story is here for the first time put into print, as in two respects, illustrative of the superstitions which had no distant. They prevailed among the rustic people of this country. If a web were now stolen in a country place, neither would the loser think of consulting the devil for the name of the culprit, nor would the culprit be in any fear of immediate vengeance from that spirit.
