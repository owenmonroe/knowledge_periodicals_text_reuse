# About this Edition

  The documents included in this edition are digital image scans of facsimile volumes of British knowledge periodicals from the 1830s. Although remediated through facsimile publication and digital imaging, these documents show pages of the popular, ephemeral periodicals _Penny Magazine_, _Saturday Magazine_, and _Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal_. 

  Through digital text extraction methods, I have found historical periodical articles that reprint texts from elsewhere on the topics of nature and animals. I have compiled them here for comparative viewing. Original page image scans can be found at the Hathi Trust Digital Library and were digitized through Google Books. I have downloaded page PDF or JPG images with reprinted text and uploaded them into the min-doc framework. I have included transcripts and introductory and supplemental notes through this framework as well.  

  This digital remediation allowed for clear digital work in both finding and presenting textual reprints within articles. In this way, article pages and content can be manipulated to create new archival contexts for further research and reading. However, this remediation also creates a distance from the original object. Some of the page scans are blurry, and both the original technological and social processes of creating and using these documents are difficult to see as well. A book facsimile may have been made with different printing technology, and material artefacts like the quality of the ink or exact typeset might be different from the original magazine. Originally created in folded sheets of eight pages for _Saturday Magazine_ and _Penny Magazine_ and four pages for _Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal_, the physical sense of the short form collection of weekly serial text in folded sheets is lost to the viewer. Similarly folds or damage to the paper material from transport or use are not accessible through this remediation. This edition does not capture individual weekly or monthly publications, instead it reveals instances of textual connections within a system of historical publication. This edition provides insight into a system of textual influence and contestation of ideas, not a whole and discrete textual artefact read in history. 

  Although remediated, these digitized facsimile editions serve as stand-ins for the original, socially used periodicals and can be used to study this historical text system. The facsimile compendia used were created at the end of a year’s printing of the serial publication. Three digitized collection volumes of _Penny Magazine_ are used in this project. Two were published in London by Charles Knight, the 1832 and 1833 collections, the same publisher of the _Penny Magazine_. A third was published in New York by J S Reid in 1838, an “American Re-issue from the English Plates.” These three volume include both facsimiles of weekly periodicals and additional “monthly supplements” of the Penny Magazine. Three volumes of _Saturday Magazine_ are used, published in 1832, 1833, and 1835. These are all published in London by John William Parker, the publisher of the magazine. In the same way, the included collected volume of _Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal_ was published in Edinburgh by the W&R Chambers Company in 1834. All of these collection volumes are held at American universities and were digitized by Google Books, made available by the Hathi Trust Digital Library, and are within the public domain. I selected these volumes because they were digitally available and contain text reprints that I identified.
