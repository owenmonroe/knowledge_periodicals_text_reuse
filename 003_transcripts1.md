## The Mocking Bird in _The Saturday Magazine_

Several stations are equally the guardians of the peace, happiness, and prosperity of the nation to which they belong; and it becomes both their duty and their interest, either to prevent the introduction of any traffic of an injurious character, or to expel that from the land which may have been found to have such a tendency. 

The facility with which ardent spirits are obtained in this country, cannot but be regarded as the cause of those habits of intemperance which defaces the fair pages of our moral history. Drunkenness prevails to a lamentable extent throughout the land, and is the fruitful source of idleness, poverty, immorality, and crime. So far from being diminished, it seems rather on the increase in the fearful change which it has wrought in the character of our artisans in labouring population, calls for the adoption of some measures to arrest its course. 
 
Ardent spirits are destructive of health, property and morals; unfit to be used by persons in health, being destitute of any nutritious quality; and the traffic in them is injurious to the prosperity of the country. Besides the misery which the use of them inflicts on individuals and families, it greatly augments the national expenditure. It increases the pores rates by increasing pauperism; it enhances the expense of judicial proceedings by promoting crime; and our hospitals and lunatic asylums are indebted to the same cause for by far the greater proportion of their wretched inmates. If the money wasted in the purchase of this worse than useless superfluidity, were spent on articles of real utility, a stimulus given to trade, manufacturers and commerce. 

Such being the consequences of the traffic and ardent spirits, as proved by incontrovertible evidence, the welfare of the nation calls for its suppression. This must be accomplished not by an appeal to the legislature for an Act of Parliament to abolish the trade, but by enlightened public opinion. If the community be convinced of the noxious qualities of ardent spirit, and the the vicious and immoral consequences to have habits of drinking lead, they will cease to buy, and the traffic must come to an end. But this object cannot be attained to the nation rise as one man to crush this enemy to its happiness. This is the result which the institutions called Temperance Societies aim to accomplish. The means they employ as simply the diffusion of information through the land, with a view to correct public opinion and unite men and women in the practice of total abstinence from distilled spirits as an article of ordinary use. They act upon the well established maxim that prevention is better than cure; and their first solicitation is to gain the countenance in support of this sober, temperate, respectable and influential classes of the community, whose combined example may operate upon this mass of the population. Such being their principle, that their principle and object, they deserve the support and assistance of every friend to humanity, and every lover of his country.

Learn of the little Nautilus to sail, 
spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale. -- Pope. 
To this little fish we are said to be indebted for one of the grandest and most useful inventions since the world began. It is thus described. It swims on the surface of the sea, on the back of its shell, which exactly resembles the whole of a ship, erases 2 feet like masts, and extends A membrane between which serves as a sail. The other two feet are employed as oars. This fish is usually found in the Mediterranean.

A Devonshire sketch by the late Reverend John Marriott of Broadclyst. 

Ye, grain hills of Devon. I love to look o'er ye;

The glowing of your verdure refreshes my sight!

in the wild and majestic let Westmoreland glory;

But yours is the palm of more tranquil delight, 

Not that robes of rich beauty in which nature dresses 

Her features of boldness, your limits disown;

to him who could deem so, deep Lymouth's recesses,

and Dart's rocky borders must all be unknown

But your own proper boast is the Combe, neatly rounded, 

which preserves through all seasons its emerald hue;

whilst the dues o'er the uplands, by which it is bounded.

in part in soft contrast, the mist's tender blue 

Not deserted, though lonely: the vale in its centre,

Girl with Barn and rough with Linhay and closes a farm;

And o'er the warm nook of its deepest indenture,

The orchards fair bloom sheds its fugitive charm.

An eye little used to such leafy profusion, 

might fancy you hedge-row one wide-waving wood;

and furze and plumed fern, as to aid the illusion,

Here and there on the tameness of culture intrude. 

But wildest the mixture of shrub, bush, and bramble,

And sweetest the scent which the wild flowers breathe,

Where the birchen-banks mark the streams devious ramble 

And the ear drinks its musical murmurs beneath. 

How soothing the sense of serenity stealing 

O'er the mind whilst on plenty and peace thus we gaze!

Less grateful, perhaps, though more lively, the feeling

Awakened by prospects that awe and amaze. 

If in those we acknowledge the symbols of greatness;

If earth's pillars its Maker's omnipotence prove;

In these let us hail Him, "whose clouds distill fatness,"

And who crowneth the year with his goodness and love

The Mocking-Bird (_Turdus polyglottus._) 
The mockingbird is a species of thrush not uncommon in many parts of North and South America and the West Indian Islands. In size, it does not exceed the European songbird and perhaps is not equal to it in the beauty of its plumage. It is however far from being an inelegant creature, but is better known for the peculiarity and amazing power of its voice, although not to gifted with any powerful weapons of self-defense. These birds display extraordinary courage in defense of their eggs and young, and will fearlessly attack any animal which may approach their haunts, even their greatest enemy, a species of black snake. 

***"To these qualities" (says Wilson, the American author), "we may add, that of a voice full, strong, and musical, and capable of almost every modulation from the clear mellow tones of the wood thrush to the savage scream of the bald eagle. In measure and accent he faithfully follows his originals in force and sweetness of expression. He greatly exceeds them in his native groves, mounted on the top of a tall Bush or a half grown tree in the dawn of Dewey morning, while the woods are vocal with the multitude of warblers. Is admirable, song rises, preeminent over every competitor. The ear can listen to his music alone, to which that of all the others seems more accompaniment. Neither is this drain altogether imitative. His own native notes, which are easily distinguished by such as are well acquainted with those of our various songbirds. Are. Full and varied, seemingly beyond all limits, his expanded wings and tail glistened with white in the buoyant gayety of his action, arresting the eye as his song most irresistibly does the ear. He sweeps around with enthusiastics. Ecstasy. He mounts or descends as his song swells, or dies away, while thus exerting himself. A bystander, destitute of sight, would suppose that the whole feathered tribes had assembled together on a trial.***

***Of skill, each striving to produce his utmost effect, so perfect are his limitation, his imitations. He many times deceives the sportsman, and sends him in search of a of birds that are perhaps not within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly imitates. Even birds themselves are frequently imposed on by this admirable mimic, and are decoyed by the fancied cause of their mates, or dive with precipitation into the depths of thickets at the scream of what they supposed to be the sparrow-hawk.***

***"The mocking-bird loses little of the power and energy of his song by confinement in his domesticated state. When he commences his career of Song, it is impossible to stand by. Uninterested, he whistles for the dog Caesar's, starts up, wags his tail, and runs to meet his master. You squeaks out like a hurt chicken in the hen, hurries about with hanging wings and bristled feathers, clucking to protect its injured brood. The barking of the dog, the mewing of the cat, the creaking of a passing wheelbarrow followed with great truth and rapidity. He repeats the tune taught him by his master, though of considerable length. Fully and faithfully he runs over the quivering ace of the Canary and the clear. The whistle ends of the Virginia Nightingale or the Red Bird, with such perior execution and effects that the mortified songsters feel their own inferiority, become altogether silent, while he seems to triumph in their defeat by redoubling his exertions.***

"Both in his native and domesticated state, during the solemn stillness of night, as soon as the moon rises in silent majesty, he begins his delightful solo and serenades us to live long night with a full display of his vocal powers, making the whole neighbourhood arraying with his inimitable melody."

A lover of Natural History cannot, I think, be a bad man, as the very study of it tends to promote a calmness and serenity of mind favorable to the reception of grateful and holy thoughts of the great and good parent of the universe. He cannot be a cool man, because he will be unwilling wantonly to destroy even an insect when he perceives how exquisitively each of them is contrived and. How curiously it is made for the station it is destined to fill in the animal world. -- Jesse.

Many methods have been suggested for saving life in cases of accidents on the water. The following was stated to me as an experiment actually made by the regulator. He had thus supported himself in the sea at Plymouth for 20 minutes and could have done it much longer as danger of overturning or of sinking appears. Have your hat in readiness and place it under your chin, holding it with your hands in the same position upon the water as on the head. The air in the Crown will prevent the water from rising and is sufficient to keep the whole head above water. Homerton, James Edmeston.

of their poetry and their chronicles. In course of time this excellence was rumoured abroad, and that scalds or bards of Iceland were invited to foreign courts. The princes of England, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, after entertaining them, most honorably dismissed them with wealth. Thus, says Doctor Holland, literature became the Icelanders species of commerce in which the fruit of their mental endowment was exchanged for those foreign luxuries or comforts, which nature had denied to them from their own soil *. As fishermen, the Icelanders were. The sailors seamen were it necessary to carry the scalds to the distant courts, and in this service or nautical skills skill was enlarged. Soon after traders went in the train of the poets, and thus obtained for the island the advantages of an increased and increasing foreign commerce.

In the year 1000, these interesting people were converted to Christianity about 50 years after their first Bishop founded their first school or college, and then the Roman alphabet was sub. Instituted for their rude and defective runic characters. Three other schools soon followed, and the monasteries which were now first erected were so many places of education during the latter half of the 11th and the whole of the 12th century. The Latin classics were diligently taught in these seminaries, and some of the poor. Icelanders even studied Greek and mechanical sciences, mathematics and astronomy, of which they felt the want in proportions as they extended. Their maritime adventures were also cultivated with assiduity. 

In the middle of the 13th century, numerous jealousies and dissensions having broken out among the chief aristocratic families, the island was by agreement transferred to the Norwegian kings. In 1380, Norway itself ceased to be an independent Kingdom. It was annexed to Denmark and Iceland went with it. Both these transfers seemed to have been affected without any violent shock and to have produced few and very slight changes in the laws and government of the country. It was owing to circumstances entirely foreign to these political changes that Iceland lost her literary sub. To see which had been almost same anomaly in the north of Europe, the fact that simply this other countries had awakened from their sleep of barbarism and began to cultivate letters and sciences.

In1402 a deadly plague carried off 2/3 of the inhabitants of Iceland. This calamity was followed by a winter so severe that not 110th part of their cattle survived survived it, and this loss again was followed by the depredations of certain barbarous English pirates. There was a consequent depression both in the moral and physical state of these unfortunate Islanders, but neither then nor at any other. Did they relapse into indolence and ignorance.

They struggled manfully with the evils that beset them present, persevering in an enlightened system of internal policy and liberal methods of education and a quiet, steady line of moral blameless conduct.

The Icelanders received their first printing press in 1530. And the Reformation of their religion soon followed its introduction. Their types were at first made of wood and very rudely formed. In 1574, one of their bishops made great improvements in the printing establishment, providing new presses and types. Some of which he made with his own hands before the conclusion of the 16th century. Many valuable books, well printed, were published and sold through the country. 

The rough, uncompromising coasts of the island continued to be visited by pirates as late as 1616. They suffered much from certain English and French freebooters,

who must indeed have been monsters to plunder a people at once so poor and so inoffensive. A still heavier calamity befell them in 1627, when some Algerians found their way to this. Islands and landing on the southern coast committed the greatest atrocities. This is one of the saddest pages in the history of the simple yet enlightened Icelanders. 40 or 50 of them were butchered, and nearly 400 of both sexes were carried off to the Mediterranean and sold the slaves. Nine years after, when the king of Denmark obtained their liberty by ransom, only 37 of the 400 were found alive, and of these 37, only 13 ever reached their native land. 

In Iceland, the 18th century was ushered in by a dreadful mortality from smallpox. In about 50 years later. About 10,000 deaths were occasioned by a famine in 1783. Panic eruptions, more terrific than had ever been seen, burst out in every direction. Deep rivers for filled up by lava. The cattle and the pastors were everywhere destroyed, and for more than a year a dense cloud of smoke and volcanic ashes covered the whole of the island. Even the sea was contaminated. The fisheries were destroyed, nor have they yet entirely recovered from the effects of those mighty convulsions. Famine and the smallpox followed in the track of this desolation destroyed a fourth part of the population. The island had scarcely begun to breathe from these calamities when, as a dependent of Denmark, it found itself involved in the miseries of the last war, and saw its commerce, now indeed limited but absolutely necessary to the existence of its inhabitants, interrupted by the powerful Navy of Great Britain. 

To the honor of our government, they sent instructions to our cruisers to respect Noah's molest the inhabitants of the Pharaoh Islands, who are in a situation even worse and more helpless than that of the Icelanders at a later. They even granted licenses to ships to trade with Iceland. 

Few countries have ever been visited by such a series of misfortunes as this. And yet between 1650 and 1810, Iceland produced from 2 to 300 respectable authors.

The Mocking-Bird 
(_Abridged from Wilson's 'American Ornithology'._)
This celebrated in very extraordinary bird, which in extent and variety of vocal powers stands unrivalled by the whole feathered songsters of America, or perhaps any other country, is peculiar to the New World and inhabits the very considerable extent of both North and South America. Having been traced from the states of New England to Brazil, and also among many of the adjacent islands, they are, however, much more numerous in those states S than those north of the river Delaware, being generally migratory in the latter and resident at least many of them in the former a warm climate and. The country, not far from the sea, seems most congenial to their nature. The species are accordingly found to be less numerous the West than east of the great range of Allegheny, in the same parallels of latitude in these regions, the berries of the red cedar Myrtle holly. Many species of Smilax, together with gum berries, gall berries in a profuse variety of others abound and furnish them with a perpetual feast. Wind insects also, of which they are very fond and very expert in catching, are there plentiful even in the winter season.

The precise time at which the mockingbird  Begins to build his nest varies according to the latitude in which he resides from the beginning of April to the middle of May. there are particular situations in which he gives the preference a solitary thorn bush an almost

#### Second Page, Left Column
impenetrable thicket, an orange tree, cedar, or hollybush are favorite spots and frequently selected. It is no great objection to the bird that a farm or Mansion House happens to be near, always ready to defend, but never over anxious to conceal his nest. BE very often builds within a small distance of the house and not unfrequently in a pair or apple tree, rarely at a greater height than six or seven feet from the ground. The nest varies a little according to the conveniency of collecting suitable materials. Generally, it is composed of first a quantity of dried twigs and sticks, then withered tops of weeds of the preceding year. Intermixed with fine straw, hay, pieces of wool and Tao, and lastly a thick layer of the fine fibrous roots of a light brown color lines the whole. The female sits 14 days and generally produces 2 broods in the same season, unless robbed of her eggs, in which case she will even build and lay the third time. She is however, very jealous of her nest and very apps to forsake it if much disturbed.

During the period of incubation, neither cat, dog, animal, nor man can approach the nest without being attacked. The cats in particular are persecuted whenever they make their appearance, till obliged to retreat. But this whole vengeance is more particularly directed against the mortal enemy of his eggs and young, the black snake. Whenever the insidious approaches of this reptile are discovered, the male darts upon it with the rapidity of an arrow, dexterously eluding its bite and striking it violently and incessantly about the head, where it's very vulnerable. The snake soon becomes sensible of its danger and seeks to escape, but the intrepid defender of his young redoubles his exertions, and, unless his antagonist be of great magnitude, often succeeds in destroying him all his pretended powers. A fascination avail. It's nothing against the vengeance of this noble bird. As the snakes shrank, begins to flag the mockingbird, seizes and lifts it up partly from the ground, beating it with its wings when the business is completed. If you return to the nest of his young, mounts the summit of the Bush, and pours forth a torrent of song in token of victory. 

The mocking-bird is 9 1/2 inches long and 13 across. When its wings are spread, some individuals are however larger and some smaller, those of the first hatch being uniformly the largest. The upper parts of the head, neck and back are a dark brownish ash and when new malted a fine light Gray. The wings and tail are nearly black. The 1st and 2nd rows of coverts tipped with white. The primary in some males are wholly white, in others tinged with brown. The three first primaries are white from their roots as far as their coverts. the white of the next 6 extends from an inch to 1 3/4 farther down descending equally on each side the feather. The tail is cuniform, the two exterior feathers wholly white, the rest except the middle ones tipped with white. The chin is white, side to the neck, breast, belly, and vent a brownish white, much purer in wild birds than those that have been domesticated. Iris of the eye yellowish, cream coloured, inclining to gold bill black, the base of the. They're bendable, whitish legs and feet, black and strong. The female much resembles the male, and it's only distinguished by the white of her wings being less pure and broad in her black feathers having a more rusty hue. 

It will be seen from this description that though the plumage of the mockingbird is none of the homeliest, it has nothing gaudy or brilliant in it, and had he nothing else to recommend him, would scarcely entitle him to notice, but his figure is well proportioned, even handsome. The elegance and rapidity of his movements, the animation of his eye and the intelligence he displays in listening and laying up lessons from almost every species of the feathered creation

While the woods are already vocal with a multitude of warblers is admirable, song rises preeminent over every competitor. The ear can listen to his music alone, to which that of all the others seem to mere accompaniment. Neither is his strain altogether imitative. His own native notes are full and varied. seemingly beyond all limits. They consist of a short expressions of 2-3 at the most, five or six syllables, generally interspersed with imitations, and all of them uttered with great emphasis and rapidity, and continued with undiminished ardour for half an hour or an hour at a time.

And send him in search of birds that are not, perhaps within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly imitates.

***The mockingbird loses little of the power and energy of his, sung by confinement in his domesticated state. When he commences his career of song, it is impossible to stand by. Uninterested, he whistles for the dog. Caesar starts up, wags his tail, and runs to meet his master.

Sellings of the Virginian Nightingale or red bird with such soup. Execution in effect, that the mortified songsters feel their own inferiority and become altogether silent while he seems to triumph their defeat by redoubling his exertions.*** 

The excessive fondness for a variety, however, in the opinion of some injures his song. His elevated imitations of the Brown Thrush are frequently interrupted by the crowing of cocks; and the warblings of the blue bird, which exquisitely manages, are mingled with the screaming of swallows or the cackling of hens. Amidst the simple melody of the Robin, one is suddenly surprised by the shrill reiterations of the whip. Poor Will. While the notes of the Kill Deer, Blue, Jay, Martin, Baltimore, and twenty others succeed with such imposing reality that the auditors looked round for the originals with astonishment, discovered that the sole performer in this singular concert is the admirable bird now before us. During this exhibition of his powers, he spreads his wings, expands his tail and throws himself around the cage, and all the ecstasy of enthusiasm, seeming not only to sing but to dance, keeping in time to the measure of his own music. Within its native and domesticated state, during the stillness of the night, as soon as the moon

rises, he begins his delightful solo, making the whole neighbourhood resound with his inimitable medley.
The mockingbird is frequently taken in trap cages and by proper management may be sufficiently tamed to sing. The usual price of a singing bird is from 7 to 15 and even $20. Mr. Wilson has known $50 paid for a remarkably fine singer;

A Well-Conducted Factory 
(_From a Correspondent._) 
The general tenor of the evidence given before the factory commissioners goes to show that although there may be great abuses in many establishments in which children are employed, extensive factories may and do exist, or the light spirits of youth are still buoyant and. Spoken by undue labor and restraint or the industry of the young that only contributes to the increase of our national wealth, but also to their own advantage, In many factories they are not only usefully employed, but at the same time are trained up in those habits of morality and good feeling which are most likely to ensure their own lasting happiness and to make them valuable members of society. 

We have recently returned from visiting many such factories and among the rest that have Mr. John Wood Junior, a stuff manufacturer of Bradford in Yorkshire. We think that it may do some good in two ways. If we give a very slight sketch of what we there saw, Such an outline may serve to correct some of the prejudices which exist in the subject of factories, generally amongst those who have never visited the seats of our great manufacturers. While those masters, we hope they are but few who look only into the accumulation of money by the employment of children, may take shame to themselves when they find that the same object may be attained without injury to their health or morals. 

In the manufactory of Mr. Wood about 600 persons, principally girls, are employed. When we

arrived it was the hour allotted to dinner and recreation and the young people were joyously sporting in the open yard of the factory like children out of school after witnessing for some time. This scene of unrestrained freedom from toil the period. For renewed industry arrived and we were ushered into the mill. This we found as. In as light and as comfortable as a drawing room, or rather as a series of drawing rooms, for there are several floors filled with machinery. The children, in resuming their work, who had not lost their cheerful look, but said about their tasks in a manner which proved that these were anything but irksome to them. Seats are provided for the accommodation of the young folks when they are not actually employed, which state of leisure from the nature of their occupation very frequently occurs. The little work people seems quite delighted to see their employer. Their faces brightened up and their eyes sparkled as he came near and spoke to them. Indeed, he appeared to be more like a father among them, and an affectionate one too, than like a master patting them on the head, chucking them under the chin and addressing them according to their ages. 

There is always a surplus number of children in the mill, in order that they may be sent by installments to a schoolroom on the premises, or they learned to knit and to sew as well as to read and to write. The reason given by their benevolent employer for having them taught knitting and needlework shows how mindful he is of their welfare. He had found that when girls who had been employed from an early age in a mill.
