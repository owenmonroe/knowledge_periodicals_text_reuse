Several stations are equally the guardians of the peace, happiness, and prosperity of the nation to which they belong; and it becomes both their duty and their interest, either to prevent the introduction of any traffic of an injurious character, or to expel that from the land which may have been found to have such a tendency. 

The facility with which ardent spirits are obtained in this country, cannot but be regarded as the cause of those habits of intemperance which defaces the fair pages of our moral history. Drunkenness prevails to a lamentable extent throughout the land, and is the fruitful source of idleness, poverty, immorality, and crime. So far from being diminished, it seems rather on the increase in the fearful change which it has wrought in the character of our artisans in labouring population, calls for the adoption of some measures to arrest its course. 
 
Ardent spirits are destructive of health, property and morals; unfit to be used by persons in health, being destitute of any nutritious quality; and the traffic in them is injurious to the prosperity of the country. Besides the misery which the use of them inflicts on individuals and families, it greatly augments the national expenditure. It increases the pores rates by increasing pauperism; it enhances the expense of judicial proceedings by promoting crime; and our hospitals and lunatic asylums are indebted to the same cause for by far the greater proportion of their wretched inmates. If the money wasted in the purchase of this worse than useless superfluidity, were spent on articles of real utility, a stimulus given to trade, manufacturers and commerce. 

Such being the consequences of the traffic and ardent spirits, as proved by incontrovertible evidence, the welfare of the nation calls for its suppression. This must be accomplished not by an appeal to the legislature for an Act of Parliament to abolish the trade, but by enlightened public opinion. If the community be convinced of the noxious qualities of ardent spirit, and the the vicious and immoral consequences to have habits of drinking lead, they will cease to buy, and the traffic must come to an end. But this object cannot be attained to the nation rise as one man to crush this enemy to its happiness. This is the result which the institutions called Temperance Societies aim to accomplish. The means they employ as simply the diffusion of information through the land, with a view to correct public opinion and unite men and women in the practice of total abstinence from distilled spirits as an article of ordinary use. They act upon the well established maxim that prevention is better than cure; and their first solicitation is to gain the countenance in support of this sober, temperate, respectable and influential classes of the community, whose combined example may operate upon this mass of the population. Such being their principle, that their principle and object, they deserve the support and assistance of every friend to humanity, and every lover of his country. 


In most quarrels there is a fault on both sides. A quarrel may be compared to a spark, which cannot be produced without a flint, as well as a steel; either of them may hammer on wood for ever, no fire will follow. 


Learn of the little Nautilus to sail, 
spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale. -- Pope. 
To this little fish we are said to be indebted for one of the grandest and most useful inventions since the world began. It is thus described. It swims on the surface of the sea, on the back of its shell, which exactly resembles the whole of a ship, erases 2 feet like masts, and extends A membrane between which serves as a sail. The other two feet are employed as oars. This fish is usually found in the Mediterranean.

A Devonshire sketch by the late Reverend John Marriott of Broadclyst. 

Ye, grain hills of Devon. I love to look o'er ye;
The glowing of your verdure refreshes my sight!
in the wild and majestic let Westmoreland glory;
But yours is the palm of more tranquil delight,  
Not that robes of rich beauty in which nature dresses 
Her features of boldness, your limits disown;
to him who could deem so, deep Lymouth's recesses,
and Dart's rocky borders must all be unknown  
But your own proper boast is the Combe, neatly rounded, 
which preserves through all seasons its emerald hue;
whilst the dues o'er the uplands, by which it is bounded.
in part in soft contrast, the mist's tender blue 
Not deserted, though lonely: the vale in its centre,
Girl with Barn and rough with Linhay and closes a farm;
And o'er the warm nook of its deepest indenture,
The orchards fair bloom sheds its fugitive charm.
An eye little used to such leafy profusion, 
might fancy you hedge-row one wide-waving wood;
and furze and plumed fern, as to aid the illusion,
Here and there on the tameness of culture intrude.  
But wildest the mixture of shrub, bush, and bramble,
And sweetest the scent which the wild flowers breathe, 
Where the birchen-banks mark the streams devious ramble 
And the ear drinks its musical murmurs beneath. 
How soothing the sense of serenity stealing 
O'er the mind whilst on plenty and peace thus we gaze!
Less grateful, perhaps, though more lively, the feeling
Awakened by prospects that awe and amaze. 
If in those we acknowledge the symbols of greatness;
If earth's pillars its Maker's omnipotence prove;
In these let us hail Him, "whose clouds distill fatness,"
And who crowneth the year with his goodness and love 


The Mocking-Bird (_Turdus polyglottus._) 
The mockingbird is a species of thrush not uncommon in many parts of North and South America and the West Indian Islands. In size, it does not exceed the European songbird and perhaps is not equal to it in the beauty of its plumage. It is however far from being an inelegant creature, but is better known for the peculiarity and amazing power of its voice, although not to gifted with any powerful weapons of self-defense. These birds display extraordinary courage in defense of their eggs and young, and will fearlessly attack any animal which may approach their haunts, even their greatest enemy, a species of black snake. 

"To these qualities" (says Wilson, the American author), "we may add, that of a voice full, strong, and musical, and capable of almost every modulation from the clear mellow tones of the wood thrush to the savage scream of the bald eagle. In measure and accent he faithfully follows his originals in force and sweetness of expression. He greatly exceeds them in his native groves, mounted on the top of a tall Bush or a half grown tree in the dawn of Dewey morning, while the woods are vocal with the multitude of warblers. Is admirable, song rises, preeminent over every competitor. The ear can listen to his music alone, to which that of all the others seems more accompaniment. Neither is this drain altogether imitative. His own native notes, which are easily distinguished by such as are well acquainted with those of our various songbirds. Are. Full and varied, seemingly beyond all limits, his expanded wings and tail glistened with white in the buoyant gayety of his action, arresting the eye as his song most irresistibly does the ear. He sweeps around with enthusiastics. Ecstasy. He mounts or descends as his song swells, or dies away, while thus exerting himself. A bystander, destitute of sight, would suppose that the whole feathered tribes had assembled together on a trial.

Of skill, each striving to produce his utmost effect, so perfect are his limitation, his imitations. He many times deceives the sportsman, and sends him in search of a of birds that are perhaps not within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly imitates. Even birds themselves are frequently imposed on by this admirable mimic, and are decoyed by the fancied cause of their mates, or dive with precipitation into the depths of thickets at the scream of what they supposed to be the sparrow-hawk.

"The mocking-bird loses little of the power and energy of his song by confinement in his domesticated state. When he commences his career of Song, it is impossible to stand by. Uninterested, he whistles for the dog Caesar's, starts up, wags his tail, and runs to meet his master. You squeaks out like a hurt chicken in the hen, hurries about with hanging wings and bristled feathers, clucking to protect its injured brood. The barking of the dog, the mewing of the cat, the creaking of a passing wheelbarrow followed with great truth and rapidity. He repeats the tune taught him by his master, though of considerable length. Fully and faithfully he runs over the quivering ace of the Canary and the clear. The whistle ends of the Virginia Nightingale or the Red Bird, with such perior execution and effects that the mortified songsters feel their own inferiority, become altogether silent, while he seems to triumph in their defeat by redoubling his exertions. 

"Both in his native and domesticated state, during the solemn stillness of night, as soon as the moon rises in silent majesty, he begins his delightful solo and serenades us to live long night with a full display of his vocal powers, making the whole neighbourhood arraying with his inimitable melody." 

A lover of Natural History cannot, I think, be a bad man, as the very study of it tends to promote a calmness and serenity of mind favorable to the reception of grateful and holy thoughts of the great and good parent of the universe. He cannot be a cool man, because he will be unwilling wantonly to destroy even an insect when he perceives how exquisitively each of them is contrived and. How curiously it is made for the station it is destined to fill in the animal world. --- Jesse. 

Many methods have been suggested for saving life in cases of accidents on the water. The following was stated to me as an experiment actually made by the regulator. He had thus supported himself in the sea at Plymouth for 20 minutes and could have done it much longer as danger of overturning or of sinking appears. Have your hat in readiness and place it under your chin, holding it with your hands in the same position upon the water as on the head. The air in the Crown will prevent the water from rising and is sufficient to keep the whole head above water. Homerton, James Edmeston.
