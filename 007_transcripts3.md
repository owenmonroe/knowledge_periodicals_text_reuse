Anecdotes of Animals 

We know a doe still alive that was brought up from a little fawn with a dairy of cows. With them it goes a field, and with them it returns to the yard. The dogs of the house take no notice of this deer being used to her. But if strange dogs come by, a chase ensues while the master smiles to see his favorite securely leading her pursuers over hedge or gate or style till she returns to the cows, who with fierce. Wings and menacing horns Dr. the assailants quite out of the pasture. Even great disparity of kind and size does not always prevent social advances and mutual fellowship. For a very intelligent and observant person has had assured me that in the former part of his life keeping but one horse, he happened to also on a time to have but one solitary hen. These two incongruous animals spent much of their time together in a lonely orchard where they saw no creature but each other by degrees, and apparent regard began to take place between these two sequestered individuals. The foul would approach the quadruped with notes of complacency, rubbing herself gently against his legs, while the horse would look down with satisfaction and move with the greatest caution and circumspection, lest he should trample on his diminutive companion. 

***The Evening Proceedings of Rooks, &c.***

In the autumn, just before dusk, they returned in a in long strings from the foraging of the day and rendezvous by thousands over Selborne.

Mungo Park in the Desert. 

Mungo Park, during his travels in the interior of Africa, was stripped and plundered by banditti on leaving a village called Kooma. When the robbers had left him almost naked and destitute, he tells u, "I sat for some time looking around me with amazement and terror. Whichever way I had turned, nothing appeared but danger and difficulty. I saw myself in the midst of a vast wilderness, in the depth of the rainy season, naked and alone, surrounded by savage animals and men still more savage. I was 500 miles from the nearest European settlement. All these circumstances crowded at Once Upon my recollection, and I confess that my spirits began to fail me. I considered my fate a certain and that I had no alternative but to lie down and perish. The influence of religion, however, aided and supported me. I reflected that no human prudence or foresight could possibly have averted my present sufferings. I was indeed a stranger in a strange land,

yet I was still under the protecting eye of that Providence who has condescended to call himself the stranger's friend. 

At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small Moss in flower irresistibly caught my eye. I mentioned this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation, for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers. I could not contemplate the delicate confirmation of the roots, leaves, etc. Without admiration. Can that being thought, I who planted, watered and brought to perfection in this? Your part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and sufferings of creatures formed after his own image. Surely nods, reflections like these cannot allow me to despair. I started up in disregarding both hunger and fatigue, traveled forwards, assured that relief was at hand and I was not disappointed. In short time I came to a small village."

The Lord's Day. 

Hail to the day which He who made the heavens, 

Earth, and their armies sanctified and blest,

Perpetual memory of the Maker's rest!

Hail to the day when He by whom was given 

New life to man, the tomb asunder riven 

Arose! That day, his Church hath still confest

At once Creation's and redemption's feast, 

Sign of a world call'd forth a world forgiven. 

Welcome that day the day of holy peace, 

The Lord's own day! to man's Creator owed, 

And man's Redeemer; for the soul's increase 

In sanctity, and the sweet repose bestowed;

Type of the rest when sin and care shall cease,

The rest remaining for the lov'd of God!

An hour of solitude passed in sincere and earnest prayer, or the conflict with in conquest over a single passion or "subtle bosom sin" will teach us more of thought, will more effectually awaken the faculty, and form the habit of reflection than a year's study in the schools without them. 

A reflecting mind is not a flower that grows wild or comes up of its own accord. The difficulty is indeed greater than many who mistake quick recollection for thought are disposed to admit, but much less than it would be had we not been born and bred in a Christian and Protestant land. Very few of us are sufficiently aware. Truly, may we, and thankfully ought we to exclaim with the Psalmist.

Choice of Seasons 

How regularly has God determined to set season for all His creatures, both their actions and their use? The stork in the heavens sayeth the prophet Jeremiah knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle and the crane in the swallow observed the time of their coming, who have seen the stork before the Callans of August or a swallow in the winter. Who hath heard the Nightingale in the heat of harvest, or the bittern bearing her base note in the coldest months? Yay, the fishes of the sea know and observe their due seasons, and present us with their Shoals only when they are wholesome and useful. The herring doth not furnish our market in the spring, nor the salmon or mackerel in the winter. Yay, the very flies both have and keep their days appointed. The silkworm never looks forth of that little cell of her conception till the Mulberry puts forth the leaves for their nourishment. And who hath ever seen a butterfly or a Hornet in winter? There are flies we know appropriate to their own months, from which they vary not. 

Lastly, how plain is this and all the several varieties of trees, flowers and herbs! The almond tree looks out first, the Mulberry, last of all the Tulip and the Rose and all the other sweet ornaments of the earth are punctual in their growth and fall. But As for man, God in his infinite wisdom has in dude him with that power of reason, whereby he may make choice of the fittest seasons of all his actions, and appointed a time for every purpose under heaven, and given him which to find an observant, even lawful acts unreasonably done. May turn to evil and act indifferent, seasonably performed. May prove good and laudable. The best improvement of morality or civility may shame us if due time be not well regarded. Only grace, piety of true virtue, can never be unseasonable. - Bishop Hall.

There are two books from which I collect my divinity, the 1 written of God, the other of his servants, Nature, that universal manuscript which he has expanded to the eyes of all. But I never so forget God as to adore the name of nature. The effects of nature are the works of God, whose hand and instruments only she is, and therefore to ascribe his actions unto her is to devolve the honours of the principal agent upon the instrument.

The Tibet Goat. 
 
Of all the domestic goats, this is the most valuable from the material which it furnishes for the production of those elegant shawls manufactured in the valley of Kashmir and its immediate vicinity. Few goats of this species have been seen in Europe, most probably from the difficulty of preserving their lives through the various changes of climate to which they must be exposed, and a journey from the bleak mountains of Tibet to the shores of countries so far distant from their own climb. They are by no means hearty animals when taken from their native hills, but soon pine and die if not attended to with extreme care. In the vessels in which the writer of this article returned from India, there were six of these animals, intended as a present for Her Majesty Queen Charlotte of England, but they all died during the passage. 

The shawl goat is small. None of those just referred to much exceed 2 feet in height. In confirmation of this I give the proportion set down by MF Cuvier. It is of moderate stature, being 2 feet high to the Withers, and its length from the snout to the inosculation of the tail, about two feet 10 inches. Its head from the tip of the snout between the horns is 9 inches, and its tail 5. Like the yak already described*, these goats are covered with long, fine hair, reaching nearly to the ground and almost entirely concealing their legs, which gives an ungainly appearance to their movements except when they gamble about their native mountains. They are indeed Beautiful Creatures. The long WAVY hair undulating over their bodies or raised by their eccentric motions gives grace to every attitude. Their hair waves slightly, but is not crisped like that of the Angola goats upon the head and neck. The coat is generally black, but white on every other part of the body, though it is sometimes all white and occasionally of a very pale grey. 

The material from which the shaws are manufactured, as they find silky down, which grows under the long hair next to the skin, is of the finest texture. As one goat produces but a small quantity, it is exceedingly expensive in the shawls produced TriMet consequently fetch great prices. 

It is by number means an easy matter to procure a shawl made solely of the Kashmir wall, as the native manufacturer is finding it so scarce A commodity, they mix it with a far less expensive material, by which the value of this shawl is considerably lessened. A large shawl may entirely of the wool of the Tibet goat Might be drawn through a moderately sized Finger ring. The color of this wall is invariably of a pale Gray, whatever may be that of the longer hair. 

There are several traits peculiar to this goat. It is a graceful and beautifully formed creature, and in its gambles displays a natural elegance of motion. Remarkably striking, but especially distinguishes it above all other animals of the Goat Tribe is that it emits no disagreeable odor, and as I believe, the only gut which does not, its habits are singularly gentle. It is a common inmate of the huts of the Mountaineers and is generally treated with great kindness. Its value is fully appreciated by the Tibetans, both for its domestic uses and for the rare material which grows upon its skin. 

Though Cuvier asserts that there are several races of the shawl goat which chiefly differ, according to his account in the length of the ears, yet he says they all produce the same wool, and seems to signify that there is no distinction of quality. He ascribes the fineness of their wool to the influence of the climate. Which?

## Rooks in _The Penny Magazine_, 1838

The Rook. 

A Rookery. 

#### Page 1, Left Column, Below Image
 
The spring is now drawing Nye with its balmy airs and its fresh vegetation. The buds will soon appear on the branches and the birds begin to sing. The snowdrop and the crocus will bring their glad tidings all about us. The stir of new life will be heard to Russell. The great business of Nature - production - recommences.

And who enjoy the excitement of the seasons more than our old friends, the rooks? What voices tell half so loudly the importance of the coming time.? They now return from their winter habitation to the old quarters - the Rookery examined the old nests, repair or build them anew, whilst the instinct of providing for their future progeny animates and directs their exertions after pairing has taken place, if there remain an odd bird, and Mr. Mudie says there is never more than one in a Rookery, he flies off, it is supposed to find some bird of the opposite sex. Similarly circumstanced; and it is believed that from 

#### Page 1, Right Column, Below Image

pairs thus formed, new rookeries date their birth. The following anecdote from Bracebridge Hall of the Rooks method of obtaining materials for the nest says much for their ingenuity and something for their cool impudence. When the birds were building, a stately old Rook would settle down upon the head of one of the Eagles who seeming conscious of the condescension. Would desist from grazing and stand fixed in motionless reverence of her August burden. The rest of the Rookery would then come Wheeling down an imitation of their leader, until every you had two or three, cawing and fluttering and battling upon her back. Anxious, doubtless to obtain their wool at the cheapest market, it has been frequently noticed that some one unhappy or offending pair vainly attempts to build the nest. For no sooner have a few sticks been put together than an attachment, probably of the Rook police, comes and demolishes the whole, the nests 

#### Page 2, Left Column

being finished when the hens begin to lay the cocks feed them. Who says Mr. White receive their bounty with a fondling tremulous voice and fluttering wings, and all the little bandish comments that are expressed by the young will and the helpless state. The gallant deportment of the males is continued through the whole season of incubation. The nests are not very warmly lined, although in so exposed situation. But the hen sit constantly to protect their young from the cold in the Romans of the parent bird for food should he fall beneath the murderous gun. Doubtless the other rooks attend with kindly solicitude to their wants. Though not eminent for its musical capabilities, Mr. White says rooks in the breeding season will sometimes, in the gayety of their hearts, attempts to sing both different success. The female lays four or five eggs. When the young are sufficiently strong. Their education begins by the parents flying repeatedly to and fro between the nest and some near branch, calling at the same time in a language we may easily translate. See how easy it is? Doubtfully and with the kind of mental head shake, we may imagine the young ones to look on, but at last the thing really appears so easy they must they will try. A preparatory flutter on the edge of the nest in the branches reached the feet is accomplished, and before long, round and round it goes. Giddy with delight at the new power it has obtained and is enjoying, they now began to find their own food when they no longer need assistance from their parents. They are dismissed to shift for themselves, and old bird has been seen to buffet heartily a young one who, being perhaps too lazy to forage for itself, wish to impose on the parental good nature. It is the love of the Rook for its young, a marked trait in its character. When seeking food for them, it will, if unsuccessful in the day, still persevere until it has obtained its object, though there are times when all its endeavours are in vain. In the hot summer of 1825, says Mr. Knapp, many of the young brood of this season perished from want. The mornings were without due and consequently fewer. No worms were to be obtained and we found them dead under the trees. Having expired on their rootings, it was particularly distressing, for no relief could be given to hear the constant clamour and importunity of the young for food. The old birds seemed to suffer without complaint. But the wants of their offspring were expressed by the unceasing cry of hunger and pursuit of the parents. First supply in our fields were scenes of daily restlessness and lament. Mr. Jesse observes that at the time when the young ones are shot according to the common annual custom, it is melancholy to watch the old birds sit apart on the neighboring trees, waiting until the sport is over, and then he returned to their young. If there be any left for them to return to after the young have fully taken wing, there is a general desertion of the Rookery until October, when the rooks returned for a short time, perhaps to examine their nests, and then again remove for the winter. 

The character of this most clear. Triple looking of birds, with its glossiest of coats and its gravest of aspects, has stood generally below, and particularly so in the estimation of one person at least, who from his position ought to have been qualified to judge more correctly. In Doctor Reese's Cyclopedia, it is said there are everywhere in many of the northern and other counties of the Kingdom, numbers of such detestable nurseries of these mischievous and rapacious vermin, etcetera. Again, though, rooks fly from his despicable abodes, etcetera, and the whole notice is written in the same spirit. The personal spite of the epithet applied to the poor bird's nest is so inexpressibly ludicrous that one can scarcely speak of the ignorant and bad feeling of the writer in the terms they deserve. And what is it? The Rook does summarize such reckless denunciations? When the young wheat is germinating, if it can find no other food, it does what all of 

#### Page 2, Right Column

us would do, it takes some to keep off starvation. From Gessler to Linnaeus, it has been called corn eater and corn gatherer. The fact of being it will not touch grain unless compelled. Under such circumstances, it will also dig up newly set potato cuttings in autumn. It exhibits more epicureanism of taste. A ripe pear or Cherry Tree will fall under contribution in an unlucky walnut tree being nearly stripped of its fruit. To these charges, the rooks, we fear, must plead guilty. But they may reasonably add that their utility ought not altogether to be forgotten, in that frequently they are the most deserving thanks when the most abused. 

In White's 'History of Selborne' we find the following passage. "Anatomists say that rooks, by reason of two large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible, have been more delicate feeling in their beak than other round build birds, and can grope for their prey when out of sight. From this circumstance Mr. White thinks that the flocks of daws and starlings frequently following a flock of rooks. Do it from the same motive that the lion follows the Jackal, the more certainly to find their prey. In frost, says Mr. Muddy, whose observations we abridge, the Rook examines wears, embankments and dams to see if insects are there doing any damage. When the compost is being spread over the field, he looks anxiously to see that no insects are among it to eat up the young plants. When the swollen stream leaves the Meadow, he picks out the noxious germs it may leave behind. In autumn, by a curious instinct distinguishing the sickly plants, he delves down to the root for the Caterpillar there at work, in short, so valuable all her services that Mister Selby says, wherever he has been extirpated or banished, the most serious injury to the corn and other crops has followed from the devastations of the Nat and the Caterpillar. Then doing all this, who is there will say the labourer is not worthy of his hire? 

"Early to bed and early to rise" is the rooks' maxim, and they do their best to instill it into their neighbors if the laborer is not forth with his plow in good time. Their noise soon awakens him as they fly a calling and clamoring about the field for their breakfast of fresh worms. He provides for them in the new made furrow. The Rook is the side of the social and unselfish. If they are pressed for room in the Rookery, he will allow a pair to build in the same fork of a branch with himself, with dignified condescension. He will also permit jackdaws and starlings to associate with him, and occasionally a Sparrow to both under his August protection in the winter, having been distressed for food. He has perhaps asked on the Seagulls shoreward domains. The goal now returns the visit in the fields in. Both pick together very fraternally. Mr. Jessie mentions a circumstance that proves the Rook to have a depth of feeling we should scarcely credit. He observes the flock, our much distressed one of them is killed or wounded by a gun. Instead of being scared away, they hover over uttering cries of distress. If wounded, the sufferer is animated in his exertions to escape by their flying to and fro gently before him, and by their cries and exhortations. I have seen, he says, one of my laborers pick up a Rook so wounded, which he had shot at for the purpose of putting up as a scarecrow in a field of wheat, and while the poor wounded bird was fluttering in his hand. I have observed one of his companions make a wheel around in the air and suddenly dart past him so as almost to touch him, perhaps with a last hope that he might still afford assistance to his unfortunate mate or companion. 

Their knowledge of the gun, or at least their idea of injury from an instrument of such appearance, is unquestionable. But they also take the alarm at the smell of gunpowder, as we believe now considered a popular error when feeding the rooks. Set a Sentinel who executes the duties of his post so well it is difficult to get within 

#### Page 3, Left Column

shot. They have also a language for by the Sentinel's cry they understand not only the danger, but the quarter from whence it is to be apprehended, as they prove by flying in an opposite direction. Unless they are to suppose their vision to be so accurate and instantaneous that the movement, the moment their attention is arrested by the alarm being given, they see its cause. 

In feeding on worms, they have been observed to beat and break them into pieces before devouring them. In hot summers they will look for grasshoppers in the hedge sides when pressed by hunger. In winter, the same cause induces them to resort to the seashore, where the periwinkle is their favorite food. They break the shell by rising with it a sufficient height in the air and then dropping it on the hardest place they can find in one very severe winter. Mr. White mentions they're resorting to dung hills close by dwelling houses. According to Mr. Muddy, the full grown Rook weighs about 9 oz and measures from tip to tip of the outspread wings, about 38 inches, is about 19 inches long. Its coat is one of the most beautiful shades of glossy black, and a rich blue tent is perceptible on the sides of the neck. It's scientific name is Corvis Frugilegus. 

In contrast to the quotation from Doctor Reese's work, we will conclude with a sweetly poetical passage from Mr. White's Selborne. ***"The evening proceedings and manoeuvres of the rooks are curious and amusing. In the autumn, just before dusk, they return in long strings from the foraging of the day and rondezvous by thousands over Selborne Down, where they wheel round in the air and sport and dive in a playful, playful manner, all the while exerting their voices and making a loud cawing.

Notices of the Month.  

February 2, Candlemass Day, so-called from the ancient customs of carrying lights and procession in honor of the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, celebrated by the Romish Church. On this day, on Candlemas Day, the Rosemary, mistletoe and other elements of the Merry Christmas times were. Moved from the halls and windows of our ancestors and the Christmas brand, to which allusion has been made in volume seven, page 439, having been lighted in a loud sub. Turn until sunset was then quenched and preserved for the succeeding year. 

Shrove tide was, in olden times a season of much feasting and supportiveness, in which the people indulged in order to console them for the fasts and mortifications of the ensuing Lent. A kindred spirit to the author of the Anatomy of Alms, stubs, seized with a sudden frenzy of alliteration, has personified Shrove Tuesday as "sole monarch of the month, high Stewards to the stomach. First they refer it to the frying pans greatest Bashar to the batter bowls protector to the pancakes first founder of the fritters. Baron of Bacon Flitch, Earl of Egg Baskets and for egg. Magnificent conclusion. The most corpulent commander of those Cholleriche things called Cookes."* The disgusting practice of beating and throwing at cocks, which was formerly a favorite pastime with the English of of this time, is now, we are happy 

* Vox Graculi',  4to., 1623, p. 55. 

#### Page 3, Right Column

to say, totally abolished, and with it many other shrove tide customs more honored in the breach than the observance. The old riotous proceedings in which school boys indulged at this season, called barring out, is still, however, connived at in some parts of the country, and the very ancient practice of tossing and eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday is not yet quite fallen into desuetude. There have been several attempts to explain the derivation of the word pancake, but the best we have met with may be found set forth in a lively little work entitled Cambridge Crepuscular Diversions, published in 1837. The author has also made several other whimsical but learned attempts to trace the derivation... Well then the silent young gentleman who sat at my left at length spoke. He was a better sort of gourmand, and this accounted for his silence, for his fish had not till now been despatched, and the last Bonnie Bouche vanished almost simultaneously with his taciturnity. He gave it for his decided opinion that Pancake owed its title to the fact of its being its sort of panacea, a general. For the ill effects of fasting, a stock of solid nourishment laid in to prevent starvation during the days of abstinence that follow Shrove Tuesday. A panacea, in fact, as good food always is against the unpleasant symptoms that follow the going without any at all. He quoted from plenty to prove this and something I think from Lucan, but I forget what at all events. He thought that he had well proved his point in the height of his self complacency, rubbed his hands famously and called to the waiter to bring a plate of pancakes, lemon and brown sugar. Which, feeding upon, he relapsed into his original silence. Of all the other conjectures that I can remember, there is about one other good one. A man who did not set up for a classic asserted that pancakes were bred seals, for he traced the derivation from their French pan, bread, and cachet, A seal being, as he asserted, merely bred, which had taken the circular form of a seal from the shape of the machine in which it was cooked. A modern etymology which sounded quite tame after the ancient ones we had been treated with.  

While we were all wondering at the many derivations the word would bear, and quite undecided which to select. One of our party exclaimed with some vehemence. Who shall tell me why this is called the pancake, when a rough Jacqueline, the voice behind me, humbly answered with a smile, while my wife and I calls them pancakes, cause they be cakes frizzed in a pan and turning round. I traced the sound to the lips of a waiter, generally the most forward among his fellows, and who hearing this exclamation with none of our previous discourse. Simply set the matter at rest and outwitted us and all our classic eruditions. You may imagine we looked at each other and wondered till we smiled and smiled till we all joined in general laugh at ourselves and each other. 

February 13. Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, was so-called from the ancient ceremony of blessing ashes on that day, with which the priest afterwards signed the people on the forehead in the form of a cross, saying, Remember that ye have come from dust, and unto dust shall ye return. Lent continues until Easter Eve. The name is derived from the Saxon Langton, signifying spring, the time of the year in which it is observed. 

February 14, Saint Valentine's Day In the year 1821, there were 200,000 letters above the average quantity passed through the 2 penny posts alone on this day, before the interchange of the poetical episodes known as Valentine's was introduced. It was the practice for gentlemen to consider the First Lady they saw on the morning of Saint Valentine's Day as their sweetheart or Valentine, to whom they are expected to make a present. These Valentine gifts are often mentioned by old writers. It's a source of great expense, Some are mentioned by
