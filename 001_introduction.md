# Introduction

  This edition presents pages from early Victorian British magazines discussing natural science. The magazines presented here reflect different interpretations of natural science discoveries and texts. The edition divides magazine articles into three sections based on animal topics: caterpillar lace, mocking birds, and rooks. Not only do the articles in each section share the same topic, they all contain an identical passage. These textual snippets, often a paragraph, are presented in a different context in each article, juxtaposed with different material on the same page. These pages reveal reprinting and quoting of text as possible paths of textual influence across publications. These same passages also reveal what the different perspectives of the periodicals and their creators. Publications include these reprinted description of nature and animals alongside discussions of many other concepts, including religious belief, industrial labor, and colonial hierarchies. Often quoting various external sources, these magazine create a textual network that affected historical readers’ understanding of nature and scientific discovery. Powerful publishers with distinct ideological goals contested ideas around science and religion in particular within these popular and ephemeral papers.

  The pages in this edition are drawn from the periodicals _The Penny Magazine_ published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), _The Saturday Magazine_ of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), and _Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal_ published by William and Robert Chambers. This edition includes text from these magazines in issues between 1832 and 1839. These three publishers made weekly general-interest non-fiction papers that were encyclopedic and factual, avoiding current event news and political opinion. They discussed a wide variety of topics, including natural science, industry and technology, history, arts, and foreign nations and customs. These publishers used new mechanized steam press and stereotype plate technologies to print and distribute many issues at low costs. Innovation in printing coincided with progressing knowledge in the sciences in the decades leading to the work of Charles Darwin. Additionally, publishers like the SDUK and SPCK were managed by prominent figures in the British government and clergy who sought to use print to edify readers according to their own belief systems. While many contemporaries published for small interest groups and political partisans, these publishers reached and created a wide audience. Read across social classes in industrial cities, these magazines participated in a revolution of communication in the early Nineteenth Century, bringing ideas and knowledge to a burgeoning mass market.
