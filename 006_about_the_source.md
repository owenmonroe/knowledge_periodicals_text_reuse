# About this Source

  In the early Nineteenth Century, British readers were introduced to ideas and information in natural science through new popular print magazines.[^1] In the 1830s, new systems of texts and relationships to reading created a field of debate about the compatibility of science and Christian religion.  Text from The Penny Magazine, The Saturday Magazine, and Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal reveal differing perspectives on nature and animals through the lenses of secular science and religion. At this time, “natural theology” was an important framework for understanding scientific discovery and the natural world. In Before Darwin, Keith Thomson writes that for many thinkers, “science and religion could share common philosophical basis” as the study of nature would confirm God’s creation.  Reverend William Paley’s 1802 text, Natural Theology, expressed this safe union of religion and natural science as it became a powerful worldview. Earlier scholars have argued that natural theology dominated elite and popular views of science leading to the publications of Charles Darwin, but the study of popular texts and readership has shown a multitude of views on the relationship of scientific and religious knowledge. Jonathan Topham argues that periodical texts directed at different groups of readers presented diverse views beyond a previously understood “common context” of natural theology.  In the 1830s and 1840s, popular books and mass-produced periodicals presented a variety of interpretations of natural history belief and scientific knowledge. 
	Twenty-first century studies show how popular early Victorian books and reading practices challenge a simple history of Darwin’s work rapidly replacing natural theology belief. In Reading the Book of Nature, Topham explains how the Bridgewater Treatises, natural science books written by leading Anglicans, reclaimed the importance of natural theology in the 1830s. However, natural theology was not a completely dominant worldview. Robert Chambers’s widely popular book, The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, drew widespread controversy for its discussion of materialist laws and natural progress that seemed to go against both natural theology and recent scientific discoveries.  Beyond these significant books, the knowledge periodicals of the 1830s presented natural science outside the framework of natural theology as well. While Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal and The Penny Magazine sought to maintain religious “neutrality,” their success sparked Anglican anxiety over irreligion.  The SPCK’s creation of The Saturday Magazine, borrowing much of the format and technical process of ThePenny Magazine, attempted to retake the market from these secular papers. Topham claims that The Saturday Magazine did not clearly advocate for a natural theology worldview, but was more religiously conservative. The periodical emphasized the importance of the Bible and criticized reliance on alternate authorities, declaring that “all knowledge is limited by religion” in its first issue. The Saturday Magazine expressed that God’s nature, laws, and purpose lay beyond unassisted human inquiry and understanding.  In this textual environment, publishers responded to each other to promote opposing ideologies and worldviews. These periodical texts present a range of views on natural science, expressing both secularism and religious conservativism outside the natural theology framework. 
	Beyond responding to larger publishing goals, these periodicals were highly intertextual and likely influenced each other’s content. The magazines reprinted materials from various external sources, creating a collage of information on a variety of topics within their pages. Alan Rauch in Useful Knowledge argues that with new texts in hand, readers of the 1830s were able to scan and choose material for themselves, to “interpret, infer, and combine the facts and details with impunity,” making knowledge while continuing to participate in the social world of work, politics, and faith.  Publishers combined facts and details too, through setting type and stereotype printing plates, often borrowing texts from other publications to forward knowledge within their own editorial agenda. As a result of quoting or borrowing, these magazines often contain identical passages placed into various contexts across publications. The same paragraph on natural science is juxtaposed with text on industrial economy in one magazine and with Christian psalms in the next. Reprinted texts were often quotes from new, authoritative books on nature, cheaply presenting snippets, reviews, or summaries for a wide audience. Magazines also included brief textual components that were sayings, stories, or pieces of advice without any clear origin. Ryan Cordell in his study of American newspapers argues that this intertextuality and combination of various sources in historical print circulations constitute a “network author.”  As quoted sources can lack clear origin or attribution, the print system circulates text as its own kind of author, filling pages and creating “viral texts” akin to today’s internet posts.  These early Victorian periodicals exhibit a similar network author effect, slotting passages about natural science into the publication’s ideological framework and the textual material that upholds it.
This edition focuses on reprinted natural science texts about animals presented across different publications and page contexts. Through these passages, both popular science texts and tensions in their reading and interpretation are made evident. In Victorian Sensation, James Secord argues that, “what once made sense as the ‘Darwinian Revolution,’ must now be recast as an episode in the industrialization of communication and the transformation of reading audiences.”  In this shifted scholarly approach, “mundane considerations” largely understood by bibliographers and librarians must be used to illuminate literary and intellectual history.   Textual technologies, modes of production and distribution, and habits of reading and reflection constructed the popular views of the progressing discoveries and the definitions of scientific inquiry and discipline. While the work of leading thinkers like Darwin strongly contributed to a lasting break between science and theology in the mid-Nineteenth Century, popular ideas of nature were not simply diffused from elites to the masses through the mediation of publishers, although many Victorians did see it this way.  In Science Serialized, Shuttleworth and Cantor argue that “engagement between reader, writer, and publisher, and the role of the scientific community itself” formed popular understandings of science and the natural world.  Secord presents these interactions and experiences of publication and reading as manifesting an emerging Victorian mass culture, and of vital import for historical study.  Printing and publication practices of these ephemeral periodicals were significant contributors to the popularization and interpretation of scientific discovery.
	The documents in this edition feature textual reprintings within their magazine publication context, showing both texts and potential printing practices within this information system. These pages were discovered within the Hathi Trust Digital Library archive through digital text reuse detection using n-gram extraction and indexing. This method uses coding to turn text into a collection of word span chunks and then creates a table organizing text chunks by associated documents where they appear. This method created a spreadsheet of snippets of text quotations organized by the magazines in which they appear. My coding created a table with rows as 7-word chunks of text and columns as the title of a magazine collection. From these snippets, I searched to find the exact page containing the quotes within the digital archive, and then downloaded images for each entire page. This method detects the industrial communication processes that define textual meaning, supporting our understanding of the ideas of this era and intellectual history more broadly. This edition features those pages containing text reprints discussing animals and natural science within their magazine pages. This method and this edition present a new context for archival study and argumentation, taking both the literary system and individual texts as objects of inquiry. A study of reprinting within the knowledge periodical text system reveals the early Victorian debate on the compatibility of science and religion. My edition presents a small set of documents containing reprinted natural science passages along with their differing contexts, showcasing popular natural science texts and the tensions present in their publication and interpretation. 
	These documents feature articles and their pages from three magazines, The Penny Magazine, The Saturday Magazine, and Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal, each published by a different organization. These publications were all weekly magazines, featuring information on natural science, industry, history, geography, and foreign customs, often without clear systems of organization for the content of each issue. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK) published issues of The Penny Magazine from 1832 to 1846.  Henry Brougham, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, and author and editor Charles Knight led the SDUK as a philanthropic organization to educate people across social classes. Centered in London, they strove to present encyclopedic facts and descriptions to their readers in a paternalistic project that eschewed content on religion or politics to reach a wide audience.  The Saturday Magazine was created by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), a philanthropic organization closely connected to the Church of England. This magazine, running from 1832 to 1844, provided religious and moral instruction alongside its general interest articles.  The Penny Magazine and The Saturday Magazine both included intricate wood engraving images to illustrate their content. Scottish brothers William and Robert Chambers created Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal in 1832, which continued for decades but reached a peak of popularity in 1844.  This publication lacked the powerful political connections of the SDUK and SPCK but featured similar content without the illustrations, occasionally including fictional stories and non-sectarian information about religion and political history. 
	These publishers used new and innovative technology to create and distribute their texts and grow a large audience of readers. New mechanized processes in typesetting, printing, and paper pressing created a revolution in text production beginning in the 1830s. The SDUK and the Chambers brothers printed their materials with Applegath and Cowper “perfecting machines.”  In these printing presses, steam powered a cylindrical platen to roll over a flat printing surface. Replacing hand-printing, these machines could print 1000 double-sided sheets per hour. This process eliminated much press hand labor and made the final product very inexpensive. The printshop floor now only required skilled type compositors, a couple of unskilled machine hands, and some workers, usually women, to fold or bind the papers. The stereotype plate printing process also drove down labor and cost. This process used molten metal to cast lines of set type into a single block of text, forming a stereotype plate to be reused in printing.  The Chambers Brothers frequently shipped stereotype plates by boat to print editions of their magazine issues in both Edinburgh and London. Water mills also quickly processed and pressed rags into paper for printing.  The Penny Magazine was printed through the Clowes and Sons company, the The Saturday Magazine worked with publisher and printer John William Parker, and the Chambers’s company printed its work through the Bradbury and Evans shop.  An issue of the Journal was four pages with three columns of text per page, while The Penny Magazine and The Saturday Magazine were eight pages long with two columns of text. Magazine issues were sold to various booksellers, who would receive texts ahead of time and open them on the official publication date.  In 1832, Chambers printed 22,250 or 24,000 copies of the their journal in Edinburgh and 20,000 in London each week.  The Penny Magazine printed a dominant 200,000 copies each week in 1832, while The Saturday Magazine reached 80,000 copies sold per week by the end of 1832.  These periodicals were affordable, often costing a penny, and purchased by middle and working class workers in urban industrial centers. These publications mass-produced through mechanical technology helped create a new and growing reading public.
	These magazines, along with other popular publications, constituted new systems of information, bringing texts to a wide readership and beginning the formation of a Victorian mass society. A connected and opinionated reading public coalesced during a period of political reform and further centralization of the national economy. In Rauch argues that in the first half of the Nineteenth Century, knowledge became aggregated and organized across society, as new texts, compendiums, encyclopedias, and eventually scientific theories and disciplines proliferated.  In “Revolutions in Thought,” Scott Bennett argues that the SDUK forged a new economic model of publishing with a marginal profit for long-term sustainability while forming new connections with widespread booksellers.  This system of production, distribution, and profit constructed a mass audience habituated to reading weekly periodicals, and later publications would capitalize on both this economic strategy and audience. 	
  These magazines were also published at a time of growing popular interest in natural history, described by Barbara Gates as a “romance, passion, and love” of  the Victorian people.  Gates argues that natural history was a “favorite pastime” of many, expressing religious interests of clergyman and evangelicals, empirical observation bordering on scientific inquiry, and a rage for materialism and collecting.  As the Nineteenth Century moved forward, magazines proliferated as Britons collected natural objects in curio cases, attended museums, and joined local clubs for experiencing, learning about, and appreciating nature. This pursuit was essentially egalitarian, as working class men and women were able to interact with natural history learning through interest organizations and inexpensive periodicals.  Natural history texts were open to different forms of appreciation and interpretation. Gates argues that Gilbert White’s 1789 The Natural History of Antiquities of Selborne – excerpted by magazine articles within this edition – was popular and valued for its different qualities throughout the Nineteenth Century. In the early decades, many praised the book for its discussion of natural theology, in the 1850s for its clear observational writing on wildlife, and at the end of the century for its value as a literary text.  This text and others also contributed to a desire and nostalgia for the British countryside and a rural lifestyle attuned to the contours of the seasons. The inclusion of pieces of White’s Selborne across different periodicals suggests interest in its writing as empirical, romantic, and spiritual within the 1830s alone. Touching on scientific discovery, religion, romantic nostalgia, and popular interests like birdwatching and collecting, periodical discussions of natural science appealed to a wide variety of interests and beliefs, expressed by different publications over time. 
At this time, many debated the social and political consequences of the spread of popular, “useful” knowledge as well. The public became aware of its new propensity for reading and organizing knowledge, as commentators reflected on this “march of the intellect” and its possible social effects, often seen with optimism and anxiety.  Many working and middle class readers realized that learning could improve social status, and institutions commented on society’s mental, and perhaps moral, improvement, as reading shifted from elitist ambition to an everyday practice.  However, working class critics argued that these texts were created by wealthy elites to indoctrinate the masses into a compliant industrial work ethic.  Parliament enforced heavy taxation on radical political periodicals, while often allowing the “unstamped” knowledge periodicals to be printed unchecked.  Others saw the reliance on knowledge as making oneself vulnerable to a loss of status as new forms of knowledge would quickly render the old obsolete.  At this time, Britons lived with residual fear of the French Revolution’s radicalism and the instability of the regency period. The Reform Act of 1832 gave a modest extension of the franchise, temporarily relaxing political tensions, yet dire poverty and class inequality persisted in an increasingly industrialized economy. Through this new organization of knowledge, ideas inevitably emerged to challenge prior systems of belief. Moral dilemmas arose around issues of politics and science, as a new working class reading public argued for greater political representation and scientific, materialist ideas challenged prior metaphysical beliefs about life and nature. Many readers also found delight and entertainment in articles that connected to popular passions like gardening, collecting natural specimens, and observing wildlife. Ultimately, individuals sought to develop their own knowledge to pursue personal interests, boost their social status, and become more socially responsible, while publishers advocated for different belief systems.  While periodical texts helped to define and guide public opinion, they also became the platform for public debates and the contestation of ideas.
